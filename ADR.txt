1. SCM - github, AWS checks changes
- dev and master branches, gitflow

2. Test env - BE, FE, DB - k8s cluster
single container for each

3. Prod env - BE, FE, DB with load balancing - k8s cluster
1 BE, 1 DB, 2 FE? Or duplicate each instance in different AZs?
	
4. Logging and monitoring system for all instances

Pushing to dev triggers CI pipeline to do:
- quality gate control
- build new docker image
- push it into registry

CD pipeline:
- deploy new image to test env (helm)
- autotests (if I make any)

Then:
- manual testing

If all OK, push to master and deploy to production
