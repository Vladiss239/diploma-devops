1. SCM - gitlab (EC2?)
- dev and master branches
2. Test env - BE, FE, DB - k8s cluster (or even not needed)
single container for each
3. Prod env - BE, FE, DB with load balancing - k8s cluster
1 BE, 1 DB, 2 FE? Or duplicate each instance in different regions?
4. Logging and monitoring system for all instances

Pushing to dev triggers pipeline to do:
- quality gate control
- build new docker image
- put it into registry
- deploy it to test env k8s
- autotests?
- manual testing
If all OK, push to master and deploy to production?
