1. SCM - gitlab (EC2?)
- dev and master branches, gitflow

2. Test env - BE, FE, DB - k8s cluster
single container for each

3. Prod env - BE, FE, DB with load balancing - k8s cluster
1 BE, 1 DB, 2 FE? Or duplicate each instance in different AZs?
	
4. Logging and monitoring system for all instances

Pushing to dev triggers pipeline to do:
- quality gate control
- build new docker image
- put it into registry
- deploy it to test env
- autotests?
- manual testing

If all OK, push to master and deploy to production?
